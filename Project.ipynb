    "# TASK1 . Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. Example of Poor Quality Structured Data\n",
    "We consider a securities trading dataset where:\n",
    "- *Timestamp* field mixes ISO 8601 format (`2023-08-15T09:30:00Z`) and local time (`Aug 15, 2023 9:30 AM EST`)\n",
    "- *Asset identifiers* inconsistently use tickers (`AAPL`), ISINs (`US0378331005`), and internal codes (`EQ123`)\n",
    "- *Transaction volumes* contain negative values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. Recognizing Poor Quality in Structured Data\n",
    "We identify three critical failures of data quality principles:\n",
    "1. **Lack of Validity**: Negative share volumes violate domain rules\n",
    "2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Timestamp heterogeneity breaches the consistency requirement for time-series analysis.\n",
    "3. **Ambiguous Identifier Schema**: Mixed asset identification methods compromise uniqueness and traceability, preventing accurate instrument mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. Example of Poor Quality Unstructured Data\n",
    "Through the course about Social Media Data , we could observe financial social media data exhibiting:\n",
    "- Tweets truncated mid-sentence due to API limitations\n",
    "- Duplicate or reposted posts from bot accounts (identical content posted or reposted  â‰¥5 times/minute)\n",
    "- Irrelevant content (e.g., meme images without financial context in a market discussion corpus)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. Assessing Poor Quality in Unstructured Data\n",
    "We would evaluate failures through these lenses:\n",
    "1. **Incompleteness**: Truncated tweets lose critical sentiment signals, violating the *comprehensiveness* requirement for NLP modeling.\n",
    "2. **Non-Uniqueness**: Bot-generated duplicates artificially inflate term frequencies, distorting *representational accuracy* of market sentiment.\n",
    "3. **Contextual Irrelevance**: Non-financial content introduces noise that breaches *fitness-for-purpose* in trading signal extraction.\n",
    "4. **Unverifiable Provenance**: Absence of user verification metadata undermines *auditability*, a core quality attribute for regulatory use cases.\n"
